# Unfolding a circular shape using Radial Unfolding

This small projects helps me in creating the design for a personal tattoo I wanted, from the contour of Bali, Indonesia, to an unrolled version of it, so that it could be printed and wrapped around the arm.

I used ChatGPT to help me out in doing so, this is the definition of the "unfolding" method he gave:

***If you interpret "unfolding" as laying out the border in a radial fashion around a central point, you could calculate the angle of each point relative to the centroid of the shape and then plot these angles against the radial distance or the cumulative distance along the border.***

Below the images from the island of Bali to the shape it resulted in:
